### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

### Built with

### What I learned

I learned that paragraph elements aren't interactive, and that the "tab-index" HTML attribute shouldn't be set above "1". 
Sadly, I learned this the hard way, but solving this challenge really boosted my understanding of accessibility and it's role in user experience.
